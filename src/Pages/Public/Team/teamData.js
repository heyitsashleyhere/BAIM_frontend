			<p>I am on my path to become a fullstack web developer. My curiosity in design and aesthetics as well as my interest for science and logic based subjects in general are perfect attributes for that matter.</p>
			<p>Therefore I feel at home in web development. Also, my desire to always learn more and new things is well served in this field.</p>
			<p>When I am not coding, I am a musician, practicing several instruments and I am playing around with music production.</p>

		bio: <div>
			<p>Born in the United States, I grew up traveling back and forth between Taipei, Los Angeles and Columbus. I am fluent in both Mandarin and English. And now adding German to that list (not counting programming languages here).</p>
			<p>My former academic background is in Industrial Design where I have worked on a variety of projects across different sectors, including branding, market research, marketing, consumer packaging, children's toys, women accessories and clothing.</p>
			<p>I started my web development journey in 2021, when a realized coding is just like riding a roller coaster: up and down, fun and addicting!</p>
			<p>This APP is our graduation project to showcase our 12 month MERN stack training program with DCI.</p>
