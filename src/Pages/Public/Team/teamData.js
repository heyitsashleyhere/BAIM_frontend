		bio: "I am on my path to become a fullstack web developer. My curiosity in design and aesthetics as well as my interest for science and logic based subjects in general are perfect attributes for that matter. Therefore I feel at home in web development. Also, my desire to always learn more and new things is well served in this field. When I am not coding, I am a musician, practicing several instruments and I am playing around with music production.",
