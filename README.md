## About

"There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about." Margaret J. Wheatley

Loka is about locality as a reply to our concerns about the negative side effects of globalization in the last decade.

Our idea comes as an inspiration from Fridays for Future, politically Green with motives to make life in the cities more sustainable wile bringing communities together and to bring individuals or local producers closer to the city consumers.

Loka is an Application that wants to produce a community library, where users can search, create , share and connect with other users, on topics of sustainability, planting, food, DIY and crafts. Loka is passionate aboutgardening, local markets, regional produce and mostly about to share knowledge and resources on topics of lifestyle and DIY. Loka is aimed for anyone , either a gardner, a food lover, a blogger , a professional, event organizers or beauty gurus.

Loka started as an idea for creating a library of regional produce in the area of Brandenburg, Berlin. Our aim was to give to the consumer a informative platform to know when to plant or eat what is in season. Our App later evolved to a create a platform like a collaborative a community library that could offer many topics around planting eating and learning. In Loka is where the consumer shares and asks for help on is own journey either planting in the balkony, or posting your recipes, or DIY products related to beauty, gardening, arts and crafts, events, etc...
