## About

> "There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about." Margaret J. Wheatley

LOKA is about the locality as a reply to our concerns about the negative side effects of globalization in the last decade.

Our idea comes as an inspiration from Fridays for Future, politically Green with motives to make life in the cities more sustainable while bringing communities together and to bring individuals or local producers closer to the city consumers.

LOKA is an Application that wants to produce a community library, where users can search, create, share and connect with other users, on topics of sustainability, planting, food, DIY, and crafts. Loka is passionate about gardening, local markets, and regional produce mostly about sharing knowledge and resources on topics of lifestyle and DIY. LOKA is aimed at anyone, either a gardener, a food lover, a blogger, a professional, an event organizer, or beauty gurus.

LOKA started as an idea for creating a library of regional produce in the area of Brandenburg, Berlin. Our aim was to give to the consumer an informative platform to know when to plant or eat what is in season. Our App later evolved to create a platform like a collaborative community library that could offer many topics around planting eating and learning. In LOKA is where the consumer shares and asks for help on their own journey either planting on the balcony, posting their recipes, or DIY products related to beauty, gardening, arts and crafts, events, etc...
